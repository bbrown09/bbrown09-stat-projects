# My Name is Bradley Brown. I grew up in Bentonville, AR, but I was born in Utah and have spent most of my life here. I am currently a Stats major at BYU with an emphasis in Data Science, but I will soon be graduating in April 2023. If there is one word that describes me, it is definitely sports. I have always had a love for competing so naturally I was drawn towards playing and watching sports of all kinds, but especially Football, Basketball, and Baseball. Extreme sports also interest me so naturally I love sky diving and skiing. I became a Statistics major to capture this love for sports in numbers and hopefully as you read my blog, you will also catch that same love for sports as well as statistics!
